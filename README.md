# **JS-Odyssey 🚀**  

Welcome to **JS-Odyssey**, my fun (and sometimes frustrating) journey through JavaScript. This repo is where I learn JS, make mistakes, and somehow survive **asynchronous programming**. Let’s see how far I get!

## **📂 Repository Structure**  

Each file covers a basic JavaScript topic. If I break something, just call it *"an experimental "* 😆  

```
JS-Odyssey/
│── 01-variables-and-data-types.js   // Variables & Data Types - Choosing between let, const, and regret
│── 02-functions-and-scope.js        // Functions & Scope - When my variables play hide and seek
│── 03-objects-and-arrays.js         // Objects & Arrays - Organizing chaos (or making it worse)
│── 04-asynchronous-programming.js   // Async & Promises - The reason I cry at night
│── 05-error-handling.js             // Error Handling - JavaScript’s way of trolling me
│── 06-dom-manipulation.js           // DOM Manipulation - Controlling the webpage like a wizard
│── 07-event-handling.js             // Event Handling - Clicking, hovering, and occasionally rage-quitting
│── 08-fetch-api.js                  // Fetch API - Talking to servers like a pro (or trying to)
│── index.html                        // The homepage of my chaos
│── README.md                         // You are here! 📖

## **🚀 My JavaScript Learning Journey**  

I **only started this because of my in-sem exam** (yes, I admit it 😅), but guess what? **I actually started liking it.** 🎉  

Here’s what I’ve painfully (*but successfully?*) learned so far:  

✅ **Variables & Data Types** (aka *"What type is this again?"*)  
✅ **Functions & Scope** 
✅ **Objects & Arrays**  
✅ **Asynchronous Programming** 
✅ **Error Handling** (aka *"Oops. Let’s pretend this bug is a feature."*)  
✅ **DOM Manipulation** 
✅ **Event Handling** (aka *"You mean clicking a button can do things?"*)  
✅ **Fetch API** (aka *"Talking to a server felt easier in movies."*)  

Next up: **Web APIs & Local Storage!** (*Will I finish? Let’s find out! 😵*)

## **🔥 Getting Started**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/JS-Odyssey.git
cd JS-Odyssey
```  

### **2️⃣ Run JavaScript Files**  
Make sure **Node.js** is installed, then run a script:  

```sh
node 01-variables-and-data-types.js
```  

For **DOM-related files**, open `index.html` in a browser.
