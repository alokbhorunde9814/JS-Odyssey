# JS-Odyssey 🚀

Welcome to **JS-Odyssey**, my fun (and sometimes confusing) journey through JavaScript. This repo is where I learn JS, make mistakes, and try to fix them. Let’s see how far I get!

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each file covers a basic JavaScript topic:

```
JS-Odyssey/
│── 01-variables-and-data-types.js  // Variables & Data Types - Picking between let, const, and regret
│── 02-functions-and-scope.js       // Functions & Scope - When my variables play hide and seek
│── 03-objects-and-arrays.js        // Objects & Arrays - Organizing data like a pro (or trying to)
│── README.md                       // You are here! 📖
```

## 🚀 My JavaScript Learning Journey
I started learning JavaScript recently, and this repo is proof that I’m trying. Here’s what I’ve covered so far:

✅ **Variables & Data Types** (aka "What type is this again?")  
✅ **Functions & Scope** (aka "Why isn’t this working?")  
✅ **Objects & Arrays** (aka "Keeping things in order")  

More topics coming soon—unless I get stuck on callbacks. 📚
